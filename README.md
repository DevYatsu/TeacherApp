# TeacherApp

For simplicity's sake, we will be using [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) as a DB for storing teacher's information and google drive as a storage for documents.

You can easily get a pastebin api key by creating an account. For Google Drive, create a new google account (for compagnies or sth like that).
